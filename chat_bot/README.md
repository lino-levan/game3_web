# Game3 Discord Chat Link

To link your game3 account to your discord account, you must type the following
into chat:

```
!link <discord_id>
```

Where `<discord_id>` is your discord user id. You can get your discord user id
by right clicking on your name in discord and clicking "Copy ID". If you don't
see "Copy ID", you need to enable developer mode in discord settings. The
community is small right now so this is honor based, but in the future we will
have a way to verify your discord account.
